# Energetic electron ring simulation

Notice this repo is on my own m1-mac. 

## Code
The code is using [osiris-4.0](https://github.com/osiris-code/osirishttps://github.com/osiris-code/osiris).

On mac the hdf5 and open-mpi are required. (Using config of m1-mac). On mac is for the test purpose as the mac I used only has 10 cpu cores. 

## To do 
- [ ] Generate 1d X-mode wave to test how to launch the wave. In this step understand how to setup the density and magnetic field. Check the power of the EM field

- [ ] Change to 2d.

## Diag

The Diag code will be summarized on organized better in the osiris_diag folder
